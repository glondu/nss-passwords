nss-passwords
=============

This program reads passwords from a Mozilla keyring. It can run
entirely in text mode. It is merely a higher level version of
pwdecrypt, which is no longer convenient for direct use with
SQLite-based and JSON-based keyrings of recent versions of Firefox.

Requirements (versions known to work are between brackets):
 - Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) [3.12.6]
     (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/)
 - Objective Caml [3.12.0]
     (http://caml.inria.fr/)
 - ocaml-fileutils [0.4.0]
     (http://ocaml-fileutils.forge.ocamlcore.org/)
 - ocaml-sqlite3 [1.5.6]
     (http://ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html#ocaml-sqlite3)
 - ppx_yojson_conv [0.17.0]
     (https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_yojson_conv)
 - some pinentry obeying the Assuan protocol
     (e.g. pinentry-curses [0.8.0] from http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/)

Usage: run with --help option

Tested with:
 - Iceweasel 3.5.11 (should be OK with Firefox of same version)
 - Iceweasel 32.0 (should be OK with Firefox of same version)
 - Icedove 3.0.6 (should be OK with Thunderbird of same version)
